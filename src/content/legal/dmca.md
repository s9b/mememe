## 5. Fair Use and Transformative Content

### Understanding Fair Use

MemeMe primarily facilitates the creation of transformative, satirical, and commentary content, which may qualify for fair use protection under copyright law. Fair use factors include:

- **Purpose and character** of the use (commercial vs. educational, transformative nature)
- **Nature** of the copyrighted work
- **Amount and substantiality** of the portion used
- **Effect** on the market for the original work

### Meme-Specific Considerations

- **Transformative use:** Memes often transform original images into commentary or parody
- **Limited use:** Typically use small portions of original works
- **Non-commercial use:** Many memes are created for personal, non-commercial expression
- **Cultural commentary:** Memes often serve as social or cultural commentary

**Note:** Fair use is a complex legal doctrine. These guidelines are not legal advice. When in doubt, consult with a qualified attorney.

## 6. Repeat Infringer Policy

### Account Actions

We maintain a policy for addressing repeat infringers:

- **First offense:** Warning and content removal
- **Second offense:** Temporary account suspension
- **Third offense:** Permanent account termination

### What Constitutes a Repeat Infringement:

- Multiple valid DMCA takedown notices against the same user
- Pattern of uploading copyrighted content without authorization
- Ignoring warnings about copyright compliance

## 7. Template Image Sources

### Our Template Library:

- Images sourced from public meme repositories
- Images believed to be in the public domain
- Images used under fair use principles for transformative purposes
- User-submitted content (users warrant they have necessary rights)

### Template Removal:

If you own rights to an image in our template library and object to its use:
- Contact us using the DMCA process above
- We will review and remove templates upon valid requests
- Removal may affect existing memes using that template

## 8. Education and Resources

### For Content Creators:

- **Use original content** when possible
- **Understand fair use** principles and limitations
- **Respect copyright** and trademark rights
- **Credit sources** when appropriate

### Good Faith Requirement:

All DMCA notices must be made in good faith. Consider whether the use might qualify as fair use before filing a takedown notice.
